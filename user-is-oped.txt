So you're running this as admin... 

This script is mainly for peons 
who are running limited accounts 
on public boxes.

You might as well just install 
Linux Subsystem, Hyper terminal 
and get vscode syncing flawlessly.
        
Honestly, running Cmder terminal 
with msys bash and a kludged 
portable vscode will seem less 
than elegant compared to the power 
to actually use what you have.

Here's what I suggest,

Run this:
    
wsl --install
    
That will install Linux subsystem

Now you're all set... 

That's much better than this 
kludge of a mess... 

Anyway, Have a nice day :)
